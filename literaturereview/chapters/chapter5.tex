\section{Conclusion}

Deep learning is fast becoming a ubiquitous tool in many aspects of our lives -- sometimes clearly visible, as with driverless cars, but in some cases more discreetly, such as the use of ML algorithms in American courts.
As deep neural networks were designed to mimic a biological brain, a phenomenon that is still not well understood, they have a \qt{black box} property that makes their reasoning is impossible to understand.
\acp{GP} may offer a way to look inside this black box, as they offer a similar flexibility and wide range of uses, and are much more easily interpreted by humans.
So far, much of the work that has been done involving \acp{GP} and ML has been comparative, rather than using one to model the other.
