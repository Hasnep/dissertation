\chapter{Conclusion}

\section{How well have each of the attempts worked?}

\begin{todo}
    The stepwise regression was not as good as the LASSO technique, which worked quite well.
\end{todo}

\section{What could be improved?}

\begin{todo}
    The 
\end{todo}

\section{How useful would more research on this topic be?}

\begin{todo}
    Clearly something pretty alright has been done, but it's not clear how well this would generalise to higher dimensions
\end{todo}

\section{What should future research on this topic focus on?}

Deep \acp{GP} (or hierarchical \acp{GP}) are analogous to deep neural networks (see Section~\ref{sec:deep-learning}), and involve chaining the output of one \ac{GP} into another to stronger model nonlinearity in the data~\autocite{damianou2013}.
