\chapter{Conclusion}

\section{How well have each of the attempts worked?}

\begin{todo}
	The stepwise regression was not as good as the LASSO technique, which worked quite well. \\
	GPs were as good as expected.
\end{todo}

\section{What could be improved?}

\section{How useful would more research on this topic be?}

\begin{todo}
	Clearly something pretty alright has been done, but it's not clear how well this would generalise to higher dimensions
\end{todo}

\section{Future research}

If using this, it would be sensible to first perform sensitivity analysis to find the significant variables.

For more complex applications, the use of \acp{GP} could be extended to deep (or hierarchical) \acp{GP}, which are analogous to \acp{DNN} (see Section~\ref{sec:deep-learning}).
\reword{They involve} chaining the output of one \ac{GP} into another to better model nonlinearity~\autocite{damianou2013}.

Use lasso as mean function and gp for everything else.
