\chapter{Introduction}

This is chapter one.

\begin{itemize}
    \item What is machine learning?
    \item Machine learning is very complex to human understanding
    \item Machine learning is widely used in many high stakes scenarios --- give examples
    \item It is important to be able to look inside the `black box' of machine learning --- explain how this would be useful in each of the given examples
    \item We can use statistical methods to try and recover the information in a ML algorithm --- give some idea how
\end{itemize}

% Since the turn of the millennium, machine learning, and particularly deep learning have been able to solve many problems that were once thought impossible for a computer.
% Machines can now identify objects~\autocite{li2018}, recommend videos~\autocite{bennett2007}, beat humans at PSPACE-hard games such as Go~\autocite{chao2018} and even drive cars~\autocite{gerla2014}.
% These tasks are so complex that designing an algorithm by hand to tackle them would be impossible, so instead, we create a set of instructions to build an algorithm, which a computer follows.
% One type of algorithm is the artificial neural network, which takes inspiration from the neural structure of biological brains.
% Artificial neural networks consist of units called \qt{neurons}, individually they perform a simple nonlinear operation, but when connected, a network of neurons can learn complex nonlinear patterns.
% Due to the abstracted nature of a machine learning algorithm's calculations, it can be difficult to provide a human understandable explanation for its reasoning, and often it is impossible.
% \qtc{grey2017}{While an individual neuron may be understood, and clusters of neurons' general purpose vaguely grasped, the whole is beyond. Nonetheless, it works}.

% These algorithms are integrated further into society and are made to evaluate more real world decisions, the ability to understand what is happening inside the \qt{black box} becomes more important.
% As autonomous vehicles are becoming more ubiquitous, we will be faced with edge cases which no human could have predicted.
% In cases where a driverless car does something unforeseen, it will be useful to have some understanding of what the algorithm was \qt{thinking} when it made the decision.
% Machine learning systems which aid in probation and parole decisions in the U.S.\ are now also being used for sentencing, but have come under a lot of criticism for being racially biased~\autocite{christin2015}.
% The question of how an algorithm can be \qt{held accountable} has been raised~\autocite[9]{christin2015}, but it is not known what accountability looks like for an unintelligible artificial mind.

% In this literature review, I will discuss the history of the field of machine learning, and then describe the idea of a Gaussian process, which has been proposed as a way to see inside the \qt{black box} of deep learning.
