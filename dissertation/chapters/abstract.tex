Machine learning and deep neural networks have seen widespread success in many applications and are set to play a larger r\^{o}le in modern society --- sometimes visibly, as with driverless cars, but in some cases more discreetly, such as the use of machine learning algorithms in the U.S.\ judicial system.
Due to their hierarchical structure, deep neural networks are very difficult or impossible for humans to understand, which could cause problems when a machine learning algorithm does something unforeseen when in a position of power.
This project uses a simple nonlinear function as an example to train a deep neural network and then applies multiple regression and Gaussian processes to the output of the neural network to try and extract human understandable meaning.
LASSO regularisation is used to reduce the regression model to a more human understandable form and is then combined with a Gaussian process to fit the neural network better.
