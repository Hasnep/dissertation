Machine learning and deep learning have expanded very quickly and seen many successes.
Due to their hierarchical structure, deep neural networks are very difficult for humans to understand, which could be a problem as machine learning algorithms take greater control of our lives.
This project uses a simple example of a deep neural network learning a nonlinear function to test various statistical methods including multiple regression and Gaussian process regression.
